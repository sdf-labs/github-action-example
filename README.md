# github-action-example

This repository contains an SDF workspace with a functional GitHub action that runs `sdf compile` on PR creation and updates. The action is defined in `.github/workflows/sdf.yml`. The action is triggered by the `pull_request` event.

For more information on how to use SDF in CI/CD with GitHub actions, see our [official documentation](https://docs.sdf.com/guide/ci_cd).
